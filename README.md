After searching for seats for half hour at Leavey library, I still could not find a single empty seat. Therefore, I decide to create a web app that tell users the nearby places where they can study or work near them. The primary audience would be students and employees who would like to get work done outside their home.

To fulfill the final project requirements, I will have 4 routes: home, about page, user profile & favorite study place list, relevant articles to increase productivity. Users would be able to search for study places, create new study places that they found out, add to their favorite list, or delete from their favorite list.

For addons, I am planning to used ember-bootstrap for better user experience.
