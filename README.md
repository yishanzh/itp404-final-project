After searching for seats for half hour at Leavey library, I still could not find a single empty seat. Therefore, I decide to create a web app that tell users the nearby places where they can study or work near them. The primary audience would be students and employees who would like to get work done outside their home.

To fulfill the final project requirements, I have routes: index, about, create, spot detail, delete, and edit. Users would be able to look through a list of study places, create new study places that they found out, add to their favorite list, or delete from their list.

For addons, I used ember-bootstrap for better user experience.
